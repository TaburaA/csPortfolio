 <p>
I thought the webpage project was really cool. I've never used HTML before so to be able to use it and play around made it really cool. This lab had us use kate and HTML to create a webpage for something we liked. I used it to advertise Cornflakes and my friend Ben's band. I was able to make the images distort and redirect to other webpages. Really cool project.

 <p>
This lab reviewed math.random(). We created lightning by randomizing a line's path and endpoint. I made it my own by not only randomizing the shape, but also the colour of the lightning and background. I also implemented an interactive element by having a mouse click reset the program.

    <summary>Dice Reflection</summary>
 <p>
This lab reviewed both math.Random() and object creation. My lab created dice objects where when you click on the screen, the color of the dice was randomized, along with the number displayed on the dice. The number on the dice was added to all the other dice, and the sum was calculated. If the sum was above a certain number, a "Win" was displayed with a congratulations and a picture of Dr. R.

    <summary>UT Austin Reflection</summary>
 <p>
This college presentation project was very eye-opening. I was able to actually talk to people who work in computer science and see what it's like in a top 10 college. Many times we get so caught up in the everyday, that we forget what CS can actually look like. Computer science can be used to do a lot of cool things, and I was able to talk to UT Austin proffesors who can make cool things happen. I learnt a lot about UT Austin, and in the presentation I talked about the demographics, statistics and interesting projects that the CS department is doing there.

    <summary>ChemoTaxis Reflection</summary>
 <p>
This is my favorite lab so far. I've always been a rap fan. I thought that ChemoTaxis sounded a lot like ChemoTravis, which is the first name of one of my favorite rappers: Travis Scott. So I decided to implement my love for rap music into this lab. This lab tested math.random() pathing and object creation. Using PImage, math.random(), and sin()/theta/tan(), I created a program that featured 8-but pictures that moved towards where the mouse was. With a little help from Dr. R, I was able to get sound to work for the program in JS. If you pressed 1,2, or 3, the Travis Scott heads would shake at differing rates, and a soundbyte of one of his songs would play. A lot of different ideas in one lab.

 <p>
For this lab we were to focus on inheritance and interfaces. My lab used triginometry, PImage and randomization to create the image of turkeys flying in random increments in a circle, along with a giant corn and pilgrim hats. Since Thanksgiving was around the corner, this lab was Thanksgiving themed. The turkeys had their own code, and by using inheritence and interfaces, the other two images were able to follow the same code without any additional work. I learnt a lot about inheritence and interfaces, much more than last year.

endX=0;
endY=500;
int colorBackgroundX= ((int)(Math.random()*256)+1);
int colorBackgroundY= ((int)(Math.random()*256)+1);
int colorBackgroundZ= ((int)(Math.random()*256)+1);

 background(colorBackgroundX,colorBackgroundY,colorBackgroundZ); 

//i//f(randomTest<4){
